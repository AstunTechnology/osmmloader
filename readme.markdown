# We've moved :) #

The osmmloader has moved to: https://github.com/AstunTechnology/Loader

## Why? ##

We've renamed and moved the osmmloader as it's no longer focused on just loading OS MasterMap data from the Ordnance Survey but can now be used for loading all sorts of GML and even KML data that needs to be prepared for loading via ogr2ogr.
